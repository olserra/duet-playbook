> **New here?** Read the [DUET Playbook](docs/duet-playbook.md): a practical first conversation, a five-step setup, and what to check before you automate. [Português](docs/duet-playbook.pt.md) · [DUET protocol](https://duetprotocol.surge.sh). 

**Instinct gets much better once it is configured.** The catch: getting a morning brief that actually helps, an evening plan for tomorrow, one nudge a day that you don't learn to ignore, watchers that warn you before you are late - that takes days of back-and-forth.

**A pack is that setup, written down once.** Send one message to your Instinct, answer a few questions, and it starts running your day. Your details stay in your Instinct. The pack itself is plain Markdown with zero personal data.

## ⚡ Install in 60 seconds

**1. Copy this and send it to your Instinct** (iMessage, WhatsApp, Slack - wherever you already talk to it):

```text
Install the "Configured Assistant" pack from Assistant Packs.
Instructions: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olserra/duet-playbook/main/packs/configured-assistant/skills/configured-assistant/SKILL.md
Modules are in the references/ folder next to it.
Run the setup interview with me, schedule only the routines I approve,
and show me a sample evening brief for tomorrow before the first one goes out.
```

**2. Answer the setup questions.** City, brief times, the numbers and news you care about, one skill to practice. Say "defaults" to go fast.

**3. Check the sample, then let it run.** Change anything later in plain words: *"move the morning brief to 6:30"*, *"drop the markets"*, *"pause everything this week"*.

**4. 👍 [issue #1](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues/1)** if it works for you. That thumbs-up is the public install counter.

> [!TIP]
> Want just one piece? Send *"Install only the morning brief module from the Configured Assistant pack"* with the same link. More install options in the pack's [INSTALL.md](packs/configured-assistant/INSTALL.md).

## 📦 The packs

| # | Pack | What your Instinct does | Languages | Status |
|:-:|------|--------------------------|:---------:|:------:|
| 1 | **[The Configured Assistant](packs/configured-assistant/)** | Morning brief · evening brief for tomorrow · one daily coaching ping · points and a Sunday scoreboard · traffic and reply watchers · weekly habit technique | 🇬🇧 🇵🇹 | ✅ **Live · free** |
| 2 | **[Inbox Zero Chief](packs/inbox-zero-chief/)** | Triage rules, reply drafts in your voice, a weekly unsubscribe sweep | 🇬🇧 | 🛠️ **Scaffolded · [help wanted](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues/2)** |
| 3 | **[Market Watch](packs/market-watch/)** | A market brief before the open (indices, currencies, crypto, headlines) · price and move alerts you set · a weekly wrap. Facts, never advice | 🇬🇧 🇵🇹 | ✅ **Live · free** |
| 4 | Family Logistics | Shared calendars, school deadlines, pickups, birthdays and gifts | - | 🗳️ [Vote](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues/3) |
| 5 | Job Search Copilot | Pipeline tracking, interview prep briefs, follow-up nudges | - | 🗳️ [Vote](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues/4) |

Missing the one you need? **[Request a pack](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues/new?template=pack-request.yml)** and 👍 the [requests you want most](https://github.com/olserra/duet-playbook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apack-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). The most-voted request is the next pack we build.

## 🧭 How packs behave

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Zero personal data** | Packs are templates. Your city, hours and interests are asked at install and stay in your Instinct. |
| 🙋 **Asks before acting for you** | A pack never messages people, books, buys or accepts invites on its own. |
| 🌱 **Adapts, doesn't nag** | Hard day? The plan shrinks and a walk counts. No second pings, no guilt. |
| 📱 **Phone-sized** | Every message reads in under a minute. |
| 🧩 **Small pieces** | Every module works alone. Take the whole pack or just the morning brief. |
| 🔎 **Checked, not remembered** | Weather, prices and news come from live sources when the message is sent. |

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Is this an official Instinct project?</b></summary>

No. Assistant Packs is an independent community project built by Instinct users. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Instinct.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does a pack read my email or calendar?</b></summary>

Only if you say yes during setup. The evening brief and the watchers work better with calendar and email access; everything else works without it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What does it cost?</b></summary>

Packs are free and MIT-licensed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I don't use Instinct. Can I still use a pack?</b></summary>

Packs are written for Instinct first. The files follow the open <a href="https://agentskills.io/specification">Agent Skills</a> format, so other assistants can read them too. See <a href="ADAPTERS.md">ADAPTERS.md</a>.
